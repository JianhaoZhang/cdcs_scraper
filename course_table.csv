The controversy over this practice already begins with the act of its naming. Genital cutting, female circumcision, female genital surgery are the names used to designate what some considered as legitimate ritualized practices while others see them as outdated misogynistic rituals. In countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia, vaginal cosmetic surgeries are growing at an exponential pace. Terminologies point to cutting-edge technologies whereas female genital cutting practices are constructed as barbaric. The course seeks to provide an understanding of the context in which a fragmented transnational sisterhood allows for a proliferation of mutilated discourses on poor and defenseless bodies. The discussion expands to bodies caught in domestic violence, rape, lynching, and vicious civil wars.",NULL,KEMEDJIO C

Key issues include sex and sexuality, the nature and rhetoric of desire, and the politics of the female body. Writers to be considered are Higuchi Ichiyô, Hirabayashi Taeko, Yamada Eimi, Miyabe Miyuki, Kanehara Hitomi, and many others.

After the discussion of RLC circuits, high-frequency narrow-band amplifiers are studied, followed by broadband amplifiers. Then we examine the important issue of noise with the design example of low-noise amplifiers (LNA). Nonlinear circuits are studied next with the examples of mixers. A study of oscillators and phase noise follows. Afterwards we introduce phase-locked loops (PLL) and frequency synthesizers. The course concludes with an overview of transceivers architectures. The course emphasizes the development of both circuit design intuition and analytical skills.

We shape ourselves even as we write our selves, and exploring the variety of early life-writing can offer us a rich new perspective on the way we tell our own story. In this course, we will be studying some of the greatest examples of early self-writing which survive, reading authors from Augustine, Dante, and Abelard to Cellini, Montaigne, and Pepys -- and ending the term with Benjamin Franklin’s famous autobiography.

As we analyze select works from women authors from the late 17th to the 19th century, we will address questions of historical, formal, and cultural significance.  What role did public condemnations of novel reading by women play in the reception of novels written by women?    How did women writers adapt the familiar conventions of the gothic and epistolary novel in ways that address the challenges of entering into a publishing industry controlled by men?

Writers of astounding talent experimented with radical forms of creativity shaped by equally radical theories of art—sometimes at the dangerous edge where dreams meet reality in “visions.” Other writers searched for new ways of capturing everyday life with unprecedented depth and intensity.

And if we accept the proposition that the reign of this strange idea is nearing the end of its history, we ought to become even more curious about how it has reigned so easily for so long.  The answer might have more to do with language and literature than we would normally assume.  If we take seriously the idea that race can be thought of as an elaborate “cultural fiction,” it makes sense to ask whether fiction and the arts actually helped to make it seem like such a significant truth of human identity.  In this class, then, we will trace the fascinating and vexing literary career of “race” in Anglophone America, from the British colonial period, to its decades of dominance in the mid-nineteenth-century U.S., and up to the twentieth-century challenges to that idea.",NULL,TAWIL E

In the face of revolutionary upheavals in social and political life and in the understanding of human psychology and personal relationships, these writers proclaimed the end of fiction as we know it. Exploring the limits and possibilities of language and form, they called into question the very idea of “the novel” and its appropriate subject matter. Looking back from our vantage in the 21st century, we will reassess what made these novels appear so shocking.

And if we accept the proposition that the reign of this strange idea is nearing the end of its history, we ought to become even more curious about how it has reigned so easily for so long.  The answer might have more to do with language and literature than we would normally assume.  If we take seriously the idea that race can be thought of as an elaborate “cultural fiction,” it makes sense to ask whether fiction and the arts actually helped to make it seem like such a significant truth of human identity.  In this class, then, we will trace the fascinating and vexing literary career of “race” in Anglophone America, from the British colonial period, to its decades of dominance in the mid-nineteenth-century U.S., and up to the twentieth-century challenges to that idea.",NULL,TAWIL E

In the face of revolutionary upheavals in social and political life and in the understanding of human psychology and personal relationships, these writers proclaimed the end of fiction as we know it. Exploring the limits and possibilities of language and form, they called into question the very idea of “the novel” and its appropriate subject matter. Looking back from our vantage in the 21st century, we will reassess what made these novels appear so shocking.

The forms are not only aesthetic (e.g., montage, allegory, novel, lyric poetry, the essay, genre, spectacle, art, beauty), but also political and economic (e.g., proletariat and bourgeoisie, class, commodity, working day, labor, value, money, strike, riot, revolution, commune, communism). While we will not survey Marxism exhaustively, we will grapple with what form is by confronting its economic, political, and aesthetic forms in the Marxist tradition.

We will look at a range of both media and historical tendencies related to the media, including manuscript culture, print, and the rise of the newspaper, novel, and modern nation-state; photography, film, television and their respective differences as visual mediums; important shifts in attitudes towards painting; the place of sound in the media of modernity; and the computerization of culture brought about by the computer, social networks, video games, and cell phones. In looking at these, we will consider both the approaches that key scholars in the field of media studies use, and the concepts that are central to the field itself (media/medium; medium-specificity; remediation; the culture industry; reification and utopia; cultural politics). By the end of the class, students will have developed a toolkit for understanding, analyzing, and even using the media that shape their lives in late modernity.",NULL,BURGES J

Through an in-depth examination of four complex urban environments – Chicago, Istanbul, Delhi, and Rome – we will learn about the interplay between space, aesthetics, time, memory, and power.

Philosophers try to understand the nature of happiness while psychologists are concerned with measuring it, but often these projects are isolated from each other. We will look at various approaches to understanding happiness and use critical reading, writing and discussion to think about how the philosophical and psychological projects are compatible, or not. We will use podcasts, popular media and scholarly articles as a jumping off point for entering these debates. Furthermore, we will focus on how writing principles such as audience and purpose function across disciplines by looking at how different fields have approached questions of happiness.

By delving into texts ranging from Emerson’s “Self-Reliance” to recent clinical literature on happiness and depression, this WRT 105 course will examine human well-being in ethical, cultural-historical, and psychological terms. Students will be encouraged to think across disciplines while learning argumentative writing through multiple stages.

NULL,Spring 2016,WRT,84768,WRT 451,THE RHETORICAL SENTENCE,3.0,NULL,"Drawing on work in linguistics and rhetorical grammar (e.g., Halliday, Biber, Kolln, Hyland), this course investigates the sentence—its structure, its potential, and its limits in creating meaning. Students will learn about the form and function of “the sentence” and its parts, develop the ability to see patterns and possibilities within and across sentences, and create and analyze sentences of wildly different shapes. Assignments will regularly involve meaningful play with sentences. Through a final project, students will investigate some aspect of the sentence in extended discourse or discuss how knowledge of the sentence might be meaningfully integrated into a writing curriculum. This course is ideal for those interested in writing, writing education, or editing. Background in linguistics or grammar is not necessary. Open to undergraduates and graduate students.",Completion of the Primary Writing Requirement.,ROSSEN-KNILL
