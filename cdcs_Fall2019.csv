The historical, social, economic, and musical factors of various black American music genres will be examined with the aim to understand how African Americans constructed identity and interpreted the world around them. We will also discuss the performative aspects of these genres in order to understand how black music artists used their bodies and asserted their agency through performance on stage.

Lectures and discussions will also highlight some of the perpetually controversial tensions that have come to define gospel music history and culture.

Behind such novelty and confusion is a larger generative force at work: photography’s pervasive role in framing selfhood, subjectivity, and identity in the modern era. Since its invention, the photographic image has framed and reframed the fluid concept of the self through various artistic, social, technological, and conceptual practices. Engaging philosophy, art history, and photography theory, this course examines how photography has been used to give shape to various philosophies of the self, from the theory of autonomy put forward by philosophers of the Enlightenment to that of identity mediated by social discourse as proposed by contemporary critical theorists. Together, we will examine various episodes from the history of photography, from explorations of Romantic subjectivity in the nineteenth century, to examinations of the “selfie” as a form of public spectaclein culture today.",AH

Some of the questions that the course will address include: 1) The basic fMRI signal just shows activation in different parts of the brain. How can we get from that to addressing questions about neural representations and neural information processing? 2) Ways of relating neural activation to behavioural performance. Can fMRI provide information over and above what can be obtained from behaviour alone? 3) Standard fMRI analysis using the General Linear Model, including preprocessing steps. 4) Multivariate fMRI analysis using machine learning approaches.
