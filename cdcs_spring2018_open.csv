This course explores four of those areas: evangelical ties connecting African American churches with South Africa’s independent church organizations; the spread of Booker T. Washington’s educational ideals in black South African academic circles; the impact of the Harlem Renaissance on African popular township culture; and the cross-fertilization of political ideologies originating on both sides of the Atlantic: Africans fighting against apartheid learned important lessons from the crusades of anti-colonial activists and internationalists in the diaspora, such as Marcus Garvey, Paul Robeson, and Mahatma Gandhi.",AAS

Photography’s attraction as an object of study is that there remains no aspect of modern life – from birth to death, from sex to war, from atoms to planets, from commerce to art – that is not touched by it in one way or another. Photography is a class of images and practices that thoroughly infiltrates and mediates the world around us. This ubiquity poses a unique problem for art history: how do we develop a method of analysis for something so functionally diverse? How can we differentiate the photograph as an object, a representation subject to manipulation, as well as what it represents with such exacting fidelity? We will address such questions by studying photography's history in relation to various social, cultural, and technological conditions from the advent of Modernism to the global spread of the camera phone.",AH

One meets the fairy at the edges of things: stiles, thresholds, dusk, puberty, inheritance. The fairy is old, whereas the term is new, and goes back far beyond its alleged Celtic origins. Its outstanding features as it developed in the Middle Ages are its uncanniness and its in-between-ness, and its association much later with childhood and death. Fairies involve themselves eagerly with human beings, but neither can belong to the other’s world without terror and loss, for which the Tale of Melusine is a major focus along with selections from Old Irish, the Mabinogi, Norse sagas, Arthurian romance, Shakespeare, Perrault, Keats, Yeats, Byatt.",ENG

It also ushered in an unprecedented era of remembrance that transformed Britain into a culture obsessed with the commemoration of its war dead – in a manner anything but ironic. Recently, scholars have begun to question not only how the war was remembered but whose war has been remembered and whose memories valued, opening the history of the war to other narratives: war as experienced by women, working class men, colonial soldiers and laborers. We will explore some of the many memoirs, poems, and other works of imaginative literature that appeared in the decades immediately following the war, as well as the appropriation and transformation of the war and its memory in late 20th-c. literature, film, and TV. We will also consider the rich body of theoretical and historical scholarship on memory work, trauma, collective memory, and memorialization, not all of it specific to WWI.",ENG

The seminar will combine the intense study of the work of particular lyric poets with the close reading of texts by important critics and theorists of the lyric.  Among the other questions we’ll consider are the nature (and fiction) of voice in lyric, the fate of the lyric “I,” the importance of formal elements (meter and rhyme, the organization of sound and syntax), the nature of linguistic play and “difficulty” in lyric poetry,  the work of metaphor, the shape of poetic memory.  The poems taken up will include Shakespeare’s sonnets, the lyrics of John Donne, and poems by John Keats, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, and Wallace Stevens.

With the arrival of Christianity, Italian missionaries increased European contact with indigenous populations and adapted their creed to local languages and preexisting customs while importing books, paintings, prints, and masters of these arts. These factors created a new and autochthonous culture born of the encounter between European culture and local traditions. The goal of the course is to analyze the nature and results of this cultural exchange between Italy and the Nuevo Mundo by examining literary and artistic sources from the discovery of America to the present, beginning with Columbus’ writings and including The Navigation by Giovan Battista Ramusio, the pictorial work of Bernardino Bitti and Angelino Medoro, and the music of Ennio Moricone",IT

While examining fashion as a way of understanding social conventions regulating women’s public and private life, we will also analyze how powerful and influential women artists like Isabella d’Este and Artemisia Gentileschi, or American art collectors in love with Italian culture, like Isabella Stewart Gardner and Peggy Guggenheim were, in fact, not merely ‘objects’ of (male) inspiration but real agents of innovation in the business world, in society, and in the artistic environment.",IT

Photography’s attraction as an object of study is that there remains no aspect of modern life – from birth to death, from sex to war, from atoms to planets, from commerce to art – that is not touched by it in one way or another. Photography is a class of images and practices that thoroughly infiltrates and mediates the world around us. This ubiquity poses a unique problem for art history: how do we develop a method of analysis for something so functionally diverse? How can we differentiate the photograph as an object, a representation subject to manipulation, as well as what it represents with such exacting fidelity? We will address such questions by studying photography's history in relation to various social, cultural, and technological conditions from the advent of Modernism to the global spread of the camera phone.",PPC

So, are identities fates we are born into, or do individuals have agency in determining what they could mean at any given time? How do 20th century American authors like Toni Morrison, Malcolm X, Elizabeth Bishop, and William Faulkner use writing to explore the myriad contestations over the meanings of different identity categories? How do such literary explorations of the tug-of-war between autonomy and determinism compare to the inquiries made by “academic” writers like Edward Said, Stuart Hall, and Judith Butler?

So what do copy editors do? Is copyediting simply about enforcing rules of correctness? When is it okay to break those rules, or to allow others to do so, and what guides such decisions? How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the information age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we will address both the principles and practices of copyediting. Students will learn the principles that guide copy editors, and then put these principles into use in a workshop setting, practicing copyediting in a variety of contexts, including digital communications.",WRT

Interdisciplinary and team problem-solving by design, the course investigates a range of potentially high-stakes translation cases involving textual, audiovisual, and multimodal renditions of a source work into a target work. These may include translating an ad or museum label; subtitling a TED Talk or foreign-language stage production; dubbing in anime or games; recasting research procedure in video; or mediated interpreting as in ethnographic studies, business meetings, or medical settings. Course readings and informal translations will support students in learning how a given situation affects the choices and strategies that translators use to maintain the viability of their work. Based on their earlier informal exercises and interests, students will work in teams and with our community partners in the 19th Ward to create final projects that provide meaningful extensions of course learning to real-world issues.",WRT
