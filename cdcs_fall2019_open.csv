This course explores four of those areas: evangelical ties connecting African American churches with South Africa’s independent church organizations; the spread of Booker T. Washington’s educational ideals in black South African academic circles; the impact of the Harlem Renaissance on African popular township culture; and the cross-fertilization of political ideologies originating on both sides of the Atlantic: Africans fighting against apartheid learned important lessons from the crusades of anti-colonial activists and internationalists in the diaspora, such as Marcus Garvey, Paul Robeson, and Mahatma Gandhi.",AAS

This course will address this theme along three lines of inquiry: female portraiture and self-portraiture, body anatomy (the nude), and women’s role in the practice of the visual arts. While examining fashion as a way of understanding social conventions regulating women’s public and private life, we will also analyze how powerful and influential women artists like Isabella d’Este and Artemisia Gentileschi, or American art collectors in love with Italian culture, like Isabella Stewart Gardner and Peggy Guggenheim were, in fact, not merely ‘objects’ of (male) inspiration but real agents of innovation in the business world, in society, and in the artistic environment.",AH

Photography’s attraction as an object of study is that there remains no aspect of modern life – from birth to death, from sex to war, from atoms to planets, from commerce to art – that is not touched by it in one way or another. Photography is a class of images and practices that thoroughly infiltrates and mediates the world around us. This ubiquity poses a unique problem for art history: how do we develop a method of analysis for something so functionally diverse? How can we differentiate the photograph as an object, a representation subject to manipulation, as well as what it represents with such exacting fidelity? We will address such questions by studying photography's history in relation to various social, cultural, and technological conditions from the advent of Modernism to the global spread of the camera phone.",AH

In addition to literature, this course will examine developments in music (Stravinsky, Scriabin), drama (the Moscow Art Theatre), painting (Vrubel, Roerich, Goncharova, Malevich), and dance (the Ballet Russe). No longer simply adapting foreign forms, Russian culture was at the forefront of the European avant-garde.

The question may seem trivial and the answer obvious, yet just what do we mean when we say a work is a copy? Is a copy the same thing as a reproduction, replication, repetition, imitation, duplicate, or facsimile? And what of related terms such as fake, forgery or counterfeit? Throughout history artists have addressed the work of others, and sometimes their own work, from the point of view of imitating it, appropriating it, and refashioning it. As a practice copying in its many forms has underpinned the production of art since earliest times. As a theory imitation precedes notions of authenticity and originality, and may be said to bring these latter concepts into being.
