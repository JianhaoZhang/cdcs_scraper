Moi and Rita Felski also consider how this view of language overrides the traditional “hermeneutics of suspicion”--a way of reading that separates “meaning” from observable language, that meaning is occult, or that it needs to be recovered from texts and speech. Both critics urge a renewed respect for the experience and contexts of reading, for how different constituencies read and talk about literature through tropes of common sense, local interest, and collective purpose. We consider, in the light of 20th century criticism and theory, how this perspective on literary study has come about. We review New Criticism and early statements by feminist and critics of color that led to Moi’s and Felski’s proposals.

Indeed, for novels centrally structured around marriage and society, madness and monstrosity appear with alarming regularity. The intertwining of these tropes suggests some of the cultural anxieties unleashed by the new body of women writers and women readers. We will begin with Frankenstein and end with Dracula, two novels from opposite ends of the century.

While examining fashion as a way of understanding social conventions regulating women’s public and private life, we will also analyze how powerful and influential women artists like Isabella d’Este and Artemisia Gentileschi, or American art collectors in love with Italian culture, like Isabella Stewart Gardner and Peggy Guggenheim were, in fact, not merely ‘objects’ of (male) inspiration but real agents of innovation in the business world, in society, and in the artistic environment.",GSW

There will be a strong focus on modern reevaluations of gender and the body and how such revaluations have transformed what it means to be “Jewish.” Topics include rites of passage, images of women in the Bible, feminist theology, as well as theories and depictions of the “Jewish body.”",JST

Students will learn about the form and function of “the sentence” and its parts, develop the ability to see patterns and possibilities within and across sentences, and create and analyze sentences of wildly different shapes. Assignments will regularly involve meaningful play with sentences. Through a final project, students will investigate some aspect of the sentence in extended discourse or discuss how knowledge of the sentence might be meaningfully integrated into a writing curriculum. This course is ideal for those interested in writing, writing education, or editing. Background in linguistics or grammar is not necessary. Open to undergraduates and graduate students.",WRT
85536,WRT 260,Writing Across Technologies,Fall 2018,4.0,Open,MW,1400,1515,LCHAS,161,15,MOHN K,Completion of the Primary Writing Requirement.,"Technology involves the development of a tool to solve a problem. In this way, writing itself can be seen a technology to aid memory, thinking, and communication. Since the invention of writing, other newer technologies have further changed how we write and how we think. Each new technology offers us a range of options that are more or less effective depending on our audience and purpose. This course will explore some of the many writing technologies that have come (and gone!) over the history of writing, from clay tablets to Snapchat. The class will take a hands-on approach and allow us opportunities to experiment with writing technologies to get a better sense of how technologies affect what we think, what we communicate, and what we think we can communicate. Students will propose individual research projects on a writing technology of their choice, which may involve some combination of original composition, scholarly research, and ethnographic study.",WRT

What is evidence? To answer these questions, students will also think deeply about how context does or does not shape our understanding of these concepts. For instance, what do arguments in STEM fields have in common with those in the humanities? Do different fields such as philosophy, psychology, and biology share evidence and argumentative strategies? Is the meaning of evidence static across these fields? We will begin by investigating different models of argument from philosophy and argumentation theory, and then students will use these broad models to investigate and analyze argument in academic contexts of their choice. We will also explore how these theoretical accounts of argument apply to popular contexts such as advertising, public deliberation, and journalism. Students will explore these issues through reflective writing, several short papers and a research project of their own design.",WRT
