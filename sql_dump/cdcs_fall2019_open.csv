The historical, social, economic, and musical factors of various black American music genres will be examined with the aim to understand how African Americans constructed identity and interpreted the world around them. We will also discuss the performative aspects of these genres in order to understand how black music artists used their bodies and asserted their agency through performance on stage.

Lectures and discussions will also highlight some of the perpetually controversial tensions that have come to define gospel music history and culture.

Behind such novelty and confusion is a larger generative force at work: photography’s pervasive role in framing selfhood, subjectivity, and identity in the modern era. Since its invention, the photographic image has framed and reframed the fluid concept of the self through various artistic, social, technological, and conceptual practices. Engaging philosophy, art history, and photography theory, this course examines how photography has been used to give shape to various philosophies of the self, from the theory of autonomy put forward by philosophers of the Enlightenment to that of identity mediated by social discourse as proposed by contemporary critical theorists. Together, we will examine various episodes from the history of photography, from explorations of Romantic subjectivity in the nineteenth century, to examinations of the “selfie” as a form of public spectaclein culture today.",AH

Grades will be based on attendance, identification quizzes, leading a discussion on the readings, and participation in a small group independent research project. Students should sign up for a recitation when signing up for the main section. BIO 102 can be used in the following clusters: ""Understanding the Biological World"" (N1BIO003), ""Life Through Time"" (N1EES005), and ""Science and Sustainability"" (N1SUS001)”",BIO

The second considers the revival of tragedy in early modern England both as a prestigious neoclassical form and as a vehicle for domestic themes traditionally associated with comedy (Marlowe, Shakespeare, Dryden). The third takes up the disappearance--or transformation--of tragedy in more recent times (Beckett, Lorca). In addition to primary texts, we will examine a number of important theories of tragedy (Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, Nietzsche, Weil, Benjamin, Arendt).

This principle of style is easier to recognize than to define. We know when we are in the presence of a distinctive style (think of famous literary stylists like Ernest Hemingway or William Faulkner), but to define it clearly is a different matter.

Major focus is placed on the use of formal languages as a tool for understanding natural language as well as on developing students' ability to implement foundational algorithms pertaining to those formal languages. Topics include basic formal language theory, finite state phonological and morphological parsing, and syntactic parsing for context free grammars and mildly context sensitive formalisms.Students who have taken the CSC17X series should consult with the instructor prior to enrollment, since there is overlap with a subset of the technical material covered in those courses. Conversely, while it is possible to enter this course with no programming experience and do well, students new to programming may wish to take CSC161 or to attend a CIRC programming bootcamp prior to taking this course.",LIN

The first section focuses on devices that motivate certain forms to take on the meanings they have.  The second section of the course moves on to discuss how meanings combine to form meanings for larger units—how words and phrases combine to form sentences meanings.  Using logical notation we illustrate the formal analysis of natural language meaning in terms of truth-conditions. We will discuss the basics of set theory, and investigate how meanings represented in these terms correlate with the syntactic and lexical structures of sentences of natural language. Students of graduate standing or those with strong formal backgrounds may consider starting with LIN 265/465 instead, for which this course is ordinarily a prerequisite. This course counts towards satisfying the core course requirement for majors.",LIN

The building blocks of words will be analyzed and topics such as affixation, reduplication and inflectional and derivational morphology will be covered.

To pursue these questions, you will need to understand how language works as a formal system, a historical process, and a source of cultural identity.
