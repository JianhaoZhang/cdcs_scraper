Throughout history artists have addressed the work of others, and sometimes their own work, from the point of view of imitating it, appropriating it, and refashioning it. As a practice copying in its many forms has underpinned the production of art since earliest times.

The analysis of the movies will be integrated with readings from the fields of history, literature, criticism, and theater.

We begin with a sampling of seminal non-Japanese titles that provided the foundation for the Godzilla film paradigm, then focus on a close textual study of select “Godzilla films” that help us understand the historical and social contexts for Godzilla’s erratic trajectory since 1954.

We will study, for instance, how social networking platforms and mobile computing have placed powerful capabilities in the hands of individuals who collectively have used them in innovative ways to break free of powerful forces, expose corruption, challenge institutional surveillance, and even bring down regimes once thought immoveable—such as in the case of the “Arab Spring.”",FMS

China has found in Africa a reliable supplier of natural resources while Africans look to China for aid and investments in agriculture, industry, infrastructure, and education. And, in a significant departure from the colonial model of economic interactions, Chinese companies do not only ship finished products to Africa; they also build factories in Africa to manufacture goods for internal use and for export.  Africans’ relations with the Chinese have become so interlocking that questions are now being raised about their potential impact on Africa. This course explores those questions on the understanding that the outcome will not only be decided in Beijing; it will also reflect African agency and history.",HIS

The study includes fundamental notions of mechanics, strength of materials, structural behavior, instrumentation failure analysis, and design optimization. Working on teams, students use constructive experimental models as well as computer-aided programs to design, build, instrument, and test realistic bridge projects. This is a self-contained course open to all Rochester undergraduates.",ME
