We will study how African American music can be used a lens through which to understand the black American experience and the social and political landscape of American society as a whole. The historical, social, economic, and musical factors of various black American music genres will be examined with the aim to understand how African Americans constructed identity and interpreted the world around them. We will also discuss the performative aspects of these genres in order to understand how black music artists used their bodies and asserted their agency through performance on stage. Genres to be explored include the 19thcentury spiritual, the blues, gospel, jazz, early rock and roll, soul music, funk, rhythm and blues, and hip hop, among others."

Throughout this course, we will attempt to answer the following questions: what is gospel music – how are the parameters of the genre defined? How has gospel music participated in constructions of black identity and spiritual formation? How has the sound and presentation of gospel music evolved – i.e. instrumentation, vocal aesthetic, performance persona, and technique? Lectures and discussions will also highlight some of the perpetually controversial tensions that have come to define gospel music history and culture. Such tensions involve the commercialization of gospel music, the ambiguity of lyrical meaning, gospel music’s flirtations with sensuality and sexuality, and debates about what constitutes “authentic” gospel music."

Behind such novelty and confusion is a larger generative force at work: photography’s pervasive role in framing selfhood, subjectivity, and identity in the modern era. Since its invention, the photographic image has framed and reframed the fluid concept of the self through various artistic, social, technological, and conceptual practices. Engaging philosophy, art history, and photography theory, this course examines how photography has been used to give shape to various philosophies of the self, from the theory of autonomy put forward by philosophers of the Enlightenment to that of identity mediated by social discourse as proposed by contemporary critical theorists. Together, we will examine various episodes from the history of photography, from explorations of Romantic subjectivity in the nineteenth century, to examinations of the “selfie” as a form of public spectaclein culture today."
