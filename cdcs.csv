We will study how African American music can be used a lens through which to understand the black American experience and the social and political landscape of American society as a whole. The historical, social, economic, and musical factors of various black American music genres will be examined with the aim to understand how African Americans constructed identity and interpreted the world around them. We will also discuss the performative aspects of these genres in order to understand how black music artists used their bodies and asserted their agency through performance on stage. Genres to be explored include the 19thcentury spiritual, the blues, gospel, jazz, early rock and roll, soul music, funk, rhythm and blues, and hip hop, among others."

Throughout this course, we will attempt to answer the following questions: what is gospel music – how are the parameters of the genre defined? How has gospel music participated in constructions of black identity and spiritual formation? How has the sound and presentation of gospel music evolved – i.e. instrumentation, vocal aesthetic, performance persona, and technique? Lectures and discussions will also highlight some of the perpetually controversial tensions that have come to define gospel music history and culture. Such tensions involve the commercialization of gospel music, the ambiguity of lyrical meaning, gospel music’s flirtations with sensuality and sexuality, and debates about what constitutes “authentic” gospel music."

Behind such novelty and confusion is a larger generative force at work: photography’s pervasive role in framing selfhood, subjectivity, and identity in the modern era. Since its invention, the photographic image has framed and reframed the fluid concept of the self through various artistic, social, technological, and conceptual practices. Engaging philosophy, art history, and photography theory, this course examines how photography has been used to give shape to various philosophies of the self, from the theory of autonomy put forward by philosophers of the Enlightenment to that of identity mediated by social discourse as proposed by contemporary critical theorists. Together, we will examine various episodes from the history of photography, from explorations of Romantic subjectivity in the nineteenth century, to examinations of the “selfie” as a form of public spectaclein culture today."

In this course, we will examine the relationship between traumatic memory and the construction or rehabilitation of meaning in various works of literature starting from shortly after the death of Mao and the end of the Cultural Revolution and reaching into the twenty-first century. In particular, we will begin with works of the “Scar” and “Root-seeking” genres from the 1970s and 1980s; in later weeks, we will analyze works from the 1990s and beyond that envisioned a range of post-socialist futures for a China that still bore (and bears) the weight of traumatic memory.

We proceed in three ways:  First, we read and discuss together a series of texts on and in visual and cultural studies.  Second, various faculty members in the program conduct sessions in their areas of expertise based on readings that they select for us.  And third, each student presents his or her own work to the colloquium.  For this final part, it is important that students engage with visual and cultural studies models and provide relevant readings to other members of the colloquium."

We will survey appropriate theories of language and communication including semiotics, post-structuralism, pragmatics, discourse analysis, and cognitive linguistics. We will consider varied and conflicting descriptions by translators of what it is they believe they are doing and what they hope to accomplish by doing it; and we will study specific translations into English from a variety of sources in order to investigate the strategies and choices translators make and the implication of those choices for our developing sense of what kinds of texts translations actually are. Finally, students will, in consultation with the instructor or with another qualified faculty member, undertake exercises in translation of their own. By the end of this class each student should have a working knowledge of both the critical backgrounds and the artistic potentials of translation."

This seminar will model for students how to do research in their MLC major through a workshop process that addresses ways to: identify a research topic/question;  begin a scholarly investigation into that topic; and successfully conduct a sustained argument that relies on textual evidence and the application of theoretical insights.

Modern poetry also increasingly probes memory’s collaboration with forgetting, the gaps and disguises of memory, its buried wounds, and its often problematic engagements with public history, public memorials. Readings will include poetry by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, John Keats, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, Robert Frost, Elizabeth Bishop, and W. S. Merwin, as well writings on memory by Saint Augustine, Sigmund Freud, and Marcel Proust."

The global reach of both its authors and audiences has made contemporary women’s writing a truly international phenomenon. We will examine what makes this work especially innovative: its experimentation with new voices and narrative forms and its blurring of genre boundaries. We will look at the dialogue it has established with the past, where it often finds its inspiration, self-consciously appropriating earlier literary texts or rewriting history.  We will also consider what special challenges this work poses for its readers. Looking at works originating in a wide range of geographic locations, this course, will explore the diverse shapes of contemporary women's imagination and attempt to account for the compelling interest of this new body of fiction."

Culturally, most people associate the term with pointed hats, black cats, and broomsticks. Historically, it refers to a threat to the social order, an enemy of the state, a confederate with the devil. Many scholars see the figure as a figment invented to attack those (usually women) perceived as defying community norms or infringing on official turf. Complicating these accounts, witch identity has been subsequently claimed by those who see in the term forgotten histories of female power, and better attitudes toward nature, gender, mind, and being. Through readings in drama, fiction, criticism, and history, this course introduces and explores this complex of perspectives on the figure of the witch. We will spend the bulk of the course in the early modern period (focusing in particular on the witch-hunting crazes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries). But we will also read ancient and current writing on this subject. Authors will include Euripides, Shakespeare, Condé, and many others."

Where did today’s standard English come from, and how is our sense of that standard tied to assumptions about race, class, gender, and nationality? To find out, we will begin roughly 5,000 years ago,studying the common ancestor of languages as different as English, Hindi, and Polish: Proto-Indo-European. We will learn about the prehistoric roots of English, then turn to the earliest written evidence of it: “Anglo-Saxon” or “Old English,” ca. 600-1100.The language was transformed in the wake of the Norman Invasion of 1066, as English became lower in status than both Anglo-Norman French and Latin for a few centuries. Next, we will learn about the growth of English, and its changes, in the age of Chaucer (Middle English) and Shakespeare (Early Modern English). Finally, we will explore processes of standardization, hybridization, and diffusion in the complex effects of English’s spread across the globe over the course of the past 450 years."

Starting with the notion ‘phoneme’, the course focuses on acoustic and articulatory phonetics, as a basis for understanding phonological processes and change in linguistic sound forms. Students will acquire skills in the production, recognition, and transcription of sounds in various languages of the world. The course will serve as a foundation for work in language documentation, sociolinguistics and sociophonetics, morphology.

Topics include basic formal language theory, finite state phonological and morphological parsing, and syntactic parsing for context free grammars and mildly context sensitive formalisms.Students who have taken the CSC17X series should consult with the instructor prior to enrollment, since there is overlap with a subset of the technical material covered in those courses.

The first section focuses on devices that motivate certain forms to take on the meanings they have.  The second section of the course moves on to discuss how meanings combine to form meanings for larger units—how words and phrases combine to form sentences meanings.  Using logical notation we illustrate the formal analysis of natural language meaning in terms of truth-conditions. We will discuss the basics of set theory, and investigate how meanings represented in these terms correlate with the syntactic and lexical structures of sentences of natural language. Students of graduate standing or those with strong formal backgrounds may consider starting with LIN 265/465 instead, for which this course is ordinarily a prerequisite.

How have Anglophone writers from the last two centuries—like Toni Morrison, Arundhati Roy, Kazuo Ishiguro, Edward Said, Stuart Hall, and Chinua Achebe—used writing to explore the meaning of different identity categories? Using peer-responses and reflections, we, too, shall try to use academic writing as we examine the various debates over this vexed term. Collaborating as an active learning community, we shall invent, draft, revise, and edit four essays, including an 8-10 page argumentative research paper."
