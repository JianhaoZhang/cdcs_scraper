Whether or not you agree, animation has achieved an aesthetic foothold in the contemporary period, evidence for which can be found in the rise of Pixar, and in the extensive use of CGI in films that can only be quaintly thought of as “live action” anymore. At times, we will seek to understand the aesthetic specificity and cultural significance of animation as a moving image medium by situating it in the visual, literary, graphic, and performing arts of both the present and the past. However, our main concern will be to understand what animation is and the different forms it takes in a variety of examples from superhero series and fantasy blockbusters; celluloid, stop motion, and digital animation; experimental cinema and television cartoons to relevant myths, fables, and children’s literature; comic books, graphic novels, and literary fiction; and cultural practices such as the silhouette and puppetry.",AH

Heine wrote ""Germany: A Winter’s Tale"" in exile, because he was no longer allowed to live in his beloved German speaking homeland without fear of state reprisal. Benjamin wrote his most important work in exile. Arendt spent her life after World War II investigating the history of totalitarianism.

The most populous African nation, Nigeria, shows similar inequality among its major ethnic nationalities. This magnitude of inequality among ethnic nationalities has given rise to serious problems in inter-group relations in the three countries.

The second considers the revival of tragedy in early modern England both as a prestigious neoclassical form and as a vehicle for domestic themes traditionally associated with comedy (Marlowe, Shakespeare, Dryden). The third takes up the disappearance--or transformation--of tragedy in more recent times (Beckett, Lorca). In addition to primary texts, we will examine a number of important theories of tragedy (Plato, Aristotle, Hegel, Nietzsche, Weil, Benjamin, Arendt). Our readings will be guided by such questions as: what might the story of this genre tell us about the longer history of representation? And how does tragedy illuminate basic problems such as the appeal of violence and vengeance, the role of religion in society, and the difficulty of finding an ethics that works for all people?",ENG

What happens when a novel is transposed to a new medium, genre, or point of view? What do the texts look like in transnational and multicultural settings? What happens when Conrad’s Heart of Darkness is refigured as a Vietnam era film or a graphic novel? What if Mrs. Dalloway is reduced to a five minute YouTube video?

We will learn about the Proto-Germanic roots of English, then turn to the earliest written evidence of it: “Anglo-Saxon” or “Old English,” ca. 600-1100. The language was transformed in the wake of the Norman Invasion of 1066, as English became the third of three languages in England: lowlier than both Anglo-Norman French and Latin. Next, we will learn about the re-emergence of English as a literary language in the age of Chaucer (Middle English) and Shakespeare (Early Modern English), as well as the role of the printing press in shaping the language. Finally, we will explore processes of standardization, hybridization, and diffusion as we track some of the complex linguistic and cultural effects of English’s spread across the globe over the course of the past 450 years.",ENG

The language was transformed in the wake of the Norman Invasion of 1066, as English became the third of three languages in England: lowlier than both Anglo-Norman French and Latin. Next, we will learn about the re-emergence of English as a literary language in the age of Chaucer (Middle English) and Shakespeare (Early Modern English), as well as the role of the printing press in shaping the language.

Why do we think of comics as kids’ books while most readers are adults? Are there stories that can only be told in comics? To answer these questions, we will engage in scholarly research and analyze exemplary texts including the biographical Holocaust narrative, Maus, and superheroes facing apocalypse in Watchmen. Through reading, writing, and discussion we will explore comics in terms of form and narrative; we’ll look at the specific strengths of comics in relation to other media. Alongside this exploration, students will develop academic writing strategies through self-reflection, peer review, and revision. Assignments will include an 8-10 page argumentative research paper and will culminate in a multimodal project of their own design.",WRT

Are there objective facts about what tastes good? Should we not eat some things? Writing about food will facilitate our becoming better writers while sharpening our skills in argumentation and critical thinking. We will learn from scientists, artists, chefs, anthropologists, philosophers, and experiences of in-class food tastings. Course texts will focus on scholarly articles but also include magazines, blogs, social media postings, and vlogs.

How should it factor into legal decisions regarding guilt and punishment? How is it influenced by race, gender, and other forms of cultural identity? Students will explore such questions as a way of developing as college-level writers and thinkers. They will watch films like A Time to Kill, read stories by Melville and Poe, and confront scholarly arguments about empathy from multiple disciplines. They will then join in the discussion about these issues, composing a series of informal responses and short formal assignments leading up to an 8-10pp argumentative research paper.

Often portrayed as a period of inconsistency, this phase seems to defer adulthood as life expectations become increasingly flexible. But, how does this new coming of age understanding impact those within this age group? Moreover, to what extent is this sense of emergence experienced across cultures? As academic writing is an act of inquiry, it will be our primary method of investigating these and other questions throughout the semester. To further critical thinking on this topic, films such as Step Brothers and books such as The Millennial Generation will be examined.
