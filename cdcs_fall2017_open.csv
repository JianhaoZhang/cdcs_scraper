How does race get mapped onto the body? In this interdisciplinary course on race and embodiment, students will encounter texts and writing assignments prompting them to think critically about how black bodies ‘matter’ in the contemporary U.S. Course materials and assignments will encourage students to explore how blackness intersects with other social categories such as gender and class at the site of the body, while exploring how these categories are socially constructed and can and should be troubled, blurred, and contested in the practice of social life.

How can we get from that to addressing questions about neural representations and neural information processing? 2) Ways of relating neural activation to behavioural performance. Can fMRI provide information over and above what can be obtained from behaviour alone? 3) Standard fMRI analysis using the General Linear Model, including preprocessing steps. 4) Multivariate fMRI analysis using machine learning approaches.

We will look at Shakespeare in both his own time and ours, to help think about why the work still speaks to us so powerfully.

First, we will consider a group of films that embodies some of the technological and aesthetic tendencies of film history from the 1970s to the present. Second, we will consider how cinema functions as a form of contemporary history, with a great deal of emphasis falling precisely on the issue of form. We will therefore delve into how films historicize the present not only through the representation of events central to the contemporary period, but also through narrative structure, visual style, performative qualities, generic choices, and media aesthetics. Focused heavily on the close reading of films, the seminar will also engage with salient scholarship in film and media studies; critical work in time studies, especially its attempt to understand contemporaneity; and relevant historiography regarding the contemporary period.",ENG

Although there is no established ""theory"" of language and gender, several sources in modern and contemporary literature and popular culture have portrayed situations in which it is possible to relate language uses to political manifestations of gender. A most effective recent text in this regard is the current Showtime series, ""Masters of Sex.""

The course emphasizes close readings of literary texts and analysis of the global contexts that prompt Japan's science fictional musings. Japanese science fiction is considered in global perspective: Japanese works are considered alongside pertinent works from other national traditions of science fiction.

Using primary and secondary sources, from vintage park brochures and marketing material to more modern scholarship on the parks’ history, ecology, and evolving roles in American life, we will craft essays and presentations that explore these beloved, yet complicated spaces.
